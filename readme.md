# Solito iOS Web Payments Example

Example Solito app that uses Stripe checkout on Web with an iOS app.

As of April 30, 2025, you can use web-based checkout on iOS without incurring Apple's commission.

Even though you're redirecting users to Web to complete their purchase, **Apple pay is still supported**. See the demo video below.

## üî¶ About

This monorepo implemented `bunx create-solito-app@latest`.

## üì¶ Included packages

- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- Next.js 15 for API routes
- Expo 53 + React Native for the native app
- `stripe` for payments
- `firebase` for authentication (you can easily swap it out)
- React Navigation 7
- React 19 (see Solito [compatibility docs](https://solito.dev/compatibility))
- React Compiler

## üóÇ Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `native`
  - `web`
    - `api`
      - Checkout routes
      - Apple `.well-known` route

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `navigation` Next.js has a `pages/` folder. React Native doesn't. This folder contains navigation-related code for RN. You may use it for any navigation code, such as custom links.

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.

## üèÅ Start the app

- Install dependencies: `bun`

- Next.js local dev: `bun web`
  - Runs `bun next` in `apps/web`
- Expo local dev:
  - First, build a dev client onto your device or simulator
    - `cd apps/native`
    - Then, either `bunx expo run:ios`
  - After building the dev client, from the root of the monorepo...
    - `bun native` (This runs `bunx expo start --dev-client`)
